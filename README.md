# images-from-webpage  
###  Optimized for Rachel


The program asks for a specific webpage url and then use beautiful soup to parse the html. All the <img> tags are retrived and then the url source is showed (by default the data-lazyload attribute is showed, but the src attribute could be shown to modifing the code). The url are searched for the ones containing "denunucia" in their strings and then only those are showed.
